Ming's Linux computer uses 4th Gen i7 4720HQ processor, based off of Haswell microarchitecture.
L1 cache 64KB per core, L2 cache 256 KB per core, L3 cache 6MB shared

4 ALUs, 3 Address Generation Units

Loop was nested so that the fastest changing variable is the leftmost to ensure unit stride.
This was not often enforced and so were more cache misses. This can be found in most components
of the BT benchmark.

High memory requirements. Problem size scaled cubicly, given the stencil was performed on 3D
matrices. There were also many auxilliary matricies used to calculated other terms used in
the CFD simulations. Given the number of floating point operations and terms required, it
used up cache memory. We see drop in performance as number of cores increased because of
restricted cache size.
